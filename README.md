# Point of Sales (POS) System - Python

This is a multi-file Python project that implements a Point of Sales system. It allows users to manage items, generate bills, and save tax transaction records. This project was developed as part of my first-year coursework for the BSc (Hons) Artificial Intelligence and Data Science degree at Informatics Institute of Technology.

## Features

- Add, update, and remove items from inventory
- Generate and print itemized bills
- Calculate totals and tax
- Save transaction data to a text file with checksum verification

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Modular programming with multiple files
- File input/output
- Hashing for checksum validation

## Project Structure
Point_of_sales/

├── main_app.py      # Main entry point to run the application

├── pos.py         # Code for the functionality of the application 

├── tax_transactions.txt # Output file with saved transactions

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
4. Run the main script:
5. Follow the on-screen menu to use the system.

## What I Learned

- How to organize code into multiple files/modules
- Handling user input and file operations in Python
- Implementing basic checksum for data integrity
